Some Example Jupyter Notebooks using [Google's DataLab](https://datalab.cloud.google.com/).

For more information you can check out my [DevFest Berlin 2015 talk](https://2015.devfest-berlin.de/) or download the slides [from the DevFest repository](https://github.com/devfest-berlin/slides/).

## Notes

You can simply upload these to your own DataLab server to run them (or use DataLab running locally).

I'll be adding more here as I have more time to play with DataLab, thanks! :)

## Questions?
