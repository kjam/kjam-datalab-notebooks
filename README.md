Some Example Jupyter Notebooks using [https://datalab.cloud.google.com/](Google's DataLab).

For more information you can check out my [https://2015.devfest-berlin.de/](2015 DevFest Berlin talk) or download the slides [https://github.com/devfest-berlin/slides/](from the DevFest repository).

## Notes

You can simply upload these to your own DataLab server to run them (or use DataLab running locally).

I'll be adding more here as I have more time to play with DataLab, thanks! :)
